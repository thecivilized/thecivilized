Hello. Welcome to the book "Against Aggression: User Manual of a Civilized Society". Since you're reading this, let's assume a few things about you.

You're not currently too busy committing an aggression. You're generally behaving like a good person. You don't steal. You don't kill. You are, in short, a Civilized person. You are part of The Civilized. You would like to have a clearer picture of what the rules of society are, or should be, in order to follow them consistently.

This book is for you.

## What is civilization?

Civilization requires the following things:

* Cooperation. Human beings are social creatures who prefer to live with other human beings. Not only that, but not living in isolation allows human beings to each specialize in something they're either better at, or enjoy more than others, or ideally both. Human beings thus have an interest in cooperating with their fellow human beings. If they didn't, if truely men were wolves for men, we would have kept on fighting one against the other. Human beings cooperating together form a society. If we didn't cooperate at all, we'd all be living as lonely hunters. If we cooperated only on a small scale, we'd still be livingas isolated hunter tribes.
* Saving of resources. If human societies consumed all of their production, we'd still be living as short-term oriented hunter-gatherer tribes. Saving of resources, investment, long term building, allow societies to strive in the long run.
* Trade. Exchanging those resources, instead of living in autarcy, which, again, doesn't allow development to go very far.
* Innovation and technological progress. Doing things better, differently, increasing production, "growth".
* Transmission of knowledge. Passing those innovations from one generation to the next.
* And, last but not least, impediments to aggression. A society is civilized if aggressio is either prevented or has some sort of consequences. Otherwise, again, by definition, there is no society, no civilization, only lone hunters fighting one against the other.

## Why should I care?

What you take for granted as "society" and "civilization" is the result of the achievement of generations of our ancestors, of peaceful interactions, of saving resources, of creative genius, of growth, of the production and accumulation of wealth. Without civilization, *even all that accumulated progress could dislocate within one generation*.

## Aggression?

In this book, we shall focus on that last element of civilization: impediments on aggression.


## Non-aggression

Non-aggression is the principle of civilization. It is widely practiced already. It is what you do when....
