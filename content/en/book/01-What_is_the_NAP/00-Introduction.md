The Principle
===

Suppose you're alone on a desert island. You do not rely on anybody, and no one relies on you. You do not work for anyone, and no one works for you. You cannot kill anyone (except yourself). You cannot commit any crime. You cannot murder, steal, rape, harm anyone. You don't need any rights, and you have no rights to respect. You spend your day fishing. You might be dimly aware of the possible existence of other people. You wonder how you would interact with them, were you to meet them?

Now suppose someone arrives on your island. So far you only had one option as far as interaction with other human beings was concerned: don't interact with anybody. Now, however, you might still have that option (if the island is big enough, each one of you can stay on his side and ignore the other). But you also have the option to interact with the other person. And if you do, there are two big ways of doing so: peacefully or aggressively. Suppose, for instance, that you realize that fishing would be done better at two than each on his own. You can either ask the newcomer nicely to help you, or you can try to use force against him.

There are all sorts of voluntary interactions: you can try convincing him, paying him, begging him.
There are all sorts of non-voluntary interactions: you can try threatening him, beating him, chaining him.

As soon as there are more than one people, we can call the sum of those people a "society". In order to exist in society, then, you must pick rules of behavior. If you want the society to be civilized, the rules must ....

this is where the Non Aggression Principle comes in.

Non-aggresion principle




## Non-aggression

Non-aggression is the principle of civilization. It is widely practiced already. It is what you do when....


Who does it apply to?

People.

It doesn't apply to things. You cannot commit an aggression against a thing.

Notice also that only actions can be made illegal. You cannot outlaw guns, or plants, because you cannot use violence against plants, or guns. You can only outlaw *actions* of actual *persons*. Keep that in mind.

By "outlaw" I mean "use violence against" in order to enforce a law...
