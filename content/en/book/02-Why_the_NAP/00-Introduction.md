Why the NAP?
===

## Because I like it and you would too if you were a good person


* it's universal, consistent, simple. it's a simple answer to lots of complex problems.
* it's civilized.
* knowing my rights are secured.
* 

Why is universality so important? Because it gives us security. Even if you put aside any common sense of basic morality, and think only of your own interests, your rights are much more secured if they are everyone's rights, not just a privilege you enjoy. What would you prefer: the knowledge that no one can ever kill you with impunity, or merely carrying a special exemption paper?
