# The Civilized

The Civilized is an open-source, public domain project. It aims both to provide a convenient content management tool for collaborative idea publishing, and to spread the ideas of civilization with it.

## The App

The Civilized Web App: "Civ". A single-page application that uses modern web development tools to offer a simple, tested, documented front-end which uses Github itself as a CMS. Fork at will.

## The Content

The Civilized Web Book: "Against aggression: user manual of a civilized society". We, the Civilized, wish to provide here the basic foundations of the philosophy of civilization, expressed as simply as possible. Read, print, translate at will.
